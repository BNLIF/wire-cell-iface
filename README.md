Wire Cell Interfaces

# Overview

This package provides a set of Interface classes which define the
problem space in which Wire Cell operates.  Other packages should
implement these interfaces and thus should depend on this package and
should **not** depend on each other.

# Dependencies

The `WireCellIface` package only depends on `WireCellUtil` and not outside package.
